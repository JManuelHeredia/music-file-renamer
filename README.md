This only works for files with current metatags available. If not the result will be something like \[missing_title]\[missing_artist].mp3

Just run ``node <files_path> ``where the mp3 files are stored

```
node D:\Music
```

For now only runs on windows because difference on path names. This will work on Linux as soon as possible. Also exceptions have to be done like already renamed files...
